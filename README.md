# ‚è≠Ô∏è Leads Tracker App

This app is developed for saving leads, websites etc. via Firebase Realtime Database.
<br/>
<br/>
Entering manually a lead/website etc and click on "SAVE INPUT" button. The data will be saved in firebase and appear in the app. <br/>
When deleting all lead/websites double click on "DELETE ALL". This will also clear the database. <br/>

Be aware that the database URL: "https://leads-tracker-app-239f0-default-rtdb.europe-west1.firebasedatabase.app/" is unique for every user so you have to create your own in order to code it. <br/>
